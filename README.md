The installation for git was somehow confusing for the first time. I didnt know what commands to typ. There may not be a lot of commands but the proper flow of commands needs to be given more attention. My experience were okay but I still need some time to practise but given that we already have the teaching and learning goin on, it was quite clearer and on what the commands would do if I were to terminate them. There are also guide on the github itself and it was helpful. Learning the branch is so useful, but I still am afraid I would so some mistakes and it will ruin everything. All in all, I still need to look from time to time on which commands to type and use.
